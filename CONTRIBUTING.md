### Reporting Bugs

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

- Ensure you're using the latest version.
- Confirm it's a bug (not a user error) by checking the [documentation](README.md).
- Search the [bug tracker](https://github.com/HackGuard/SQLiGuard/issues?q=label%3Abug) to see if it's already reported.
- Gather relevant details like:
  - Stack trace
  - OS, platform, and version
  - Interpreter and library versions
  - Input, output, and reproduction steps

#### How to Submit a Bug Report

- Open a new [Issue](https://github.com/HackGuard/SQLiGuard/issues/new) without labeling.
- Provide clear reproduction steps, expected vs. actual behavior, and relevant code.
- Include the information you've gathered.

After submission, the project team will review and label the issue appropriately for resolution.

### Suggesting Enhancements

#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure your enhancement aligns with the project’s objectives.

1. **Use the Latest Version**: Make sure you're using the latest version of SQLiGuard.
2. **Review Documentation**: Check the [documentation](README.md) to see if your desired functionality is available.
3. **Check Existing Suggestions**: Search the [issues](https://github.com/HackGuard/SQLiGuard/issues) to see if your enhancement has been suggested. If so, add a comment instead of opening a new one.

#### How to Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion
Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/HackGuard/SQLiGuard/issues). To submit an effective suggestion, follow these steps:

- **Title**: Use a **clear and descriptive title**.
- **Description**: Provide a **step-by-step description** of the enhancement.
- **Current vs. Expected Behavior**: Describe the **current** and **expected behavior**, highlighting the need for change and any alternatives.
- **Visual Aids**: Include **screenshots or GIFs** to illustrate your suggestion. Use [LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) for macOS/Windows and [Byzanz](https://gitlab.gnome.org/Archive/byzanz) for Linux.
- **Explain Benefits**: Discuss the enhancement's benefits for users, referencing other projects that have successfully addressed similar needs.
